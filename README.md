## Notes App implemented using Clean Architecture Principles

This is going to be a helper project that showcases what i learned while implementing [Uncle Bob's Clean Code Principles](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for iOS.

Main programming/iOS aspects featured here:
```
- CoreData 
- Multiple Targets
- Repository Pattern 
- Advanced Models
- Data binding using RxSwift
- Flow Coordinator

```

Our goal is to create a simple "Friends" app that will contain a list of all your friends & their birthdays.
